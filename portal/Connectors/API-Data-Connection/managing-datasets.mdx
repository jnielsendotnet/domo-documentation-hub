# Managing Datasets

DataSets enable visualizations, alerts, and user collaboration that ultimately allows businesses to make data driven decisions and then take action.  Since data a foundation to the Domo platform, it is important to maintain the accuracy and ownership of datasets.  The DataSet API enables you to automate processes to ensure DataSets have the correct information, access, and ownership.

**Note:** Only DataSets created with the API can be updated via APIs.


### Changing DataSet owner
---
Often there may be a case where an owner of a DataSet has changed companies and has had their access removed or simply changed roles in a company and is no longer responsible for the maintenance of a DataSet.  In these cases, the DataSet API allows you to programmatically make updates by first querying for all DataSets owned by a user and then updating each with the new owner's user ID.

### Updating a DataSet schema
---
At times it is necessary to update the DataSet's schema.  Please note that if a DataSet's schema is updated.

#### Sample Request

See this sample request in [Java](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-java-sdk/blob/master/domo-java-sdk-all/src/test/java/com/domo/sdk/datasets/UpdateExample.java), [Python](https://github.com/domoinc/domo-python-sdk/blob/master/examples/dataset.py).

```HTTP
PUT https://api.domo.com/v1/datasets/317970a1-6a6e-4f70-8e09-44cf5f34cf44
Content-Type: application/json
Accept: application/json

    }, {
      "type": "STRING",

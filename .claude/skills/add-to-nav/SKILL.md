---

Insert a page into `docs.json` navigation, or move an existing page to a new location.

The user has provided: $ARGUMENTS

---

## Overview

`docs.json` is the Mintlify navigation manifest. It is ~307KB and deeply nested:
**language → tab → group → (optional subgroup) → pages array**

Pages are string entries like `"s/article/Article-Title"` or `"portal/some-slug"`.

This skill makes targeted, surgical edits — never reads the full file.

---

## Step 1: Gather information

Ask the user for the following, one question at a time if not already provided:

1. **Page path** — the string to insert (e.g., `s/article/Access-Tokens`). If `$ARGUMENTS` contains a plausible path, confirm it rather than re-asking.

2. **Operation** — Insert (new page, not yet in `docs.json`) or Move (page already exists and needs to be relocated)?

3. **Target location** — Where should the page appear? Ask the user to describe by:
   - Tab name (e.g., "Knowledge Base", "API Reference")
   - Group and subgroup names in order (e.g., "Admin" > "Security")
   - Position within the group: beginning, end, or after a specific page (allow the user to provide either the document title or the mdx file name)

4. **For Move only** — Confirm the current location so you know where to remove it from. You can find it automatically (see Step 2), but confirm with the user before deleting.

---

## Step 2: Locate targets in docs.json

`docs.json` is too large to read in full. Use targeted searches.

**To find the target group:**
```bash
grep -n "\"group\": \"<Group Name>\"" docs.json
```
This returns line numbers. Read ±30 lines around each match to confirm context (tab, parent group). If multiple matches exist, show them to the user and ask which one is correct.

**For a Move — to find the page's current location:**
```bash
grep -n "\"<page-path>\"" docs.json
```
Read ±15 lines around the match to confirm context before removing.

**To read a slice of the file:**
Use the Read tool with `offset` and `limit` parameters (line numbers from grep output).

---

## Step 3: Plan the edit

Before making changes, describe the plan to the user:
- What line(s) will change
- What the before/after will look like
- For a Move: that the old entry will be removed

Get confirmation before proceeding.

---

## Step 4: Make the edits

Use the Edit tool to make surgical changes. Always include enough surrounding context (2–3 lines before and after) to make the `old_string` match unique.

### Inserting at the end of a group's pages array

If the target group ends like:
```json
            "pages": [
              "s/article/some-article",
              "s/article/last-article"
            ]
```

Edit to:
```json
            "pages": [
              "s/article/some-article",
              "s/article/last-article",
              "s/article/New-Article"
            ]
```

### Inserting at the beginning of a group's pages array

```json
            "pages": [
              "s/article/New-Article",
              "s/article/existing-first-article",
```

### Inserting after a specific page

Find the specific page string and add the new entry on the next line with a comma on the preceding line if needed.

### Moving a page

1. First, perform the insertion at the new location (as above).
2. Then, remove the old entry. Find the line and remove it, adjusting trailing commas on adjacent lines as needed to keep valid JSON.

**Always ensure valid JSON** — no trailing commas on the last item in an array.

---

## Step 5: Verify

After editing, run:
```bash
node -e "JSON.parse(require('fs').readFileSync('docs.json', 'utf8')); console.log('docs.json is valid JSON');"
```

If this fails, show the error and fix it before finishing.

---

## Output

Tell the user:
- What was changed (insertion point, any removal)
- The exact path string that was added
- That they can preview the nav locally with `mintlify dev`

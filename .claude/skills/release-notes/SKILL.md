description: Generate user-friendly release notes by diffing the latest git tag against the previous tag and summarizing the changes.

# Release Notes Generator

Produce a friendly, email/Slack-ready release notes summary for the most recent git tag in this repo.

## Workflow

### 1. Identify the release range

```bash
git tag --sort=-creatordate | head -5
```

The top tag is the **latest release**; the next tag is the **previous release**. Confirm with the user only if the intended target is ambiguous (e.g. multiple tags on the same day, or user mentions a specific version).

Also grab tag dates for context:

```bash
git log --tags --simplify-by-decoration --pretty="format:%ai %d" | head -10
```

### 2. Diff the releases

```bash
git log <prev-tag>..<latest-tag> --stat
```

For any commit whose purpose isn't obvious from the message + file list, inspect the content:

```bash
git diff <prev-tag>..<latest-tag> -- <path>
```

Skip merge-commit noise — focus on the underlying PRs and file changes. Group related commits (e.g. multiple commits from one PR) into a single theme.

### 3. Summarize into themes

Group changes into 2–5 themed sections. Each theme gets:
- An emoji + short title (e.g. "📚 Domo.js Versioned Documentation")
- 1–3 sentences describing what changed and why it matters **to the reader** (developers, admins, customers — not internal mechanics)
- Attribution to the contributor(s) by name — pull author names from `git log`

Prefer customer-visible framing over commit-message literalism. "DOMO-482176: add v4 doc" becomes "Dedicated version-specific docs for Domo.js v4, v5, and v6."

### 4. Write the file

Save to `releaseNotes/v<version>.txt` (plain text, not MDX — this is meant to be copy/pasted into email or Slack).

Follow this structure:

```
Hello everyone!

We're excited to announce that version <X.Y.Z> of the Domo Documentation Hub is now available! <one-sentence framing of the release's overall theme>


🌟 What's New

<emoji> <Theme Title>
<1–3 sentences describing the change and its value.>
Thanks to <Contributor> for <brief reason>.

<repeat for each theme>


🙏 Thank You

A heartfelt thank you to everyone who contributed to this release. <one warm closing sentence>

If you have questions or feedback, please reach out — we're always happy to help!
```

Keep tone warm and appreciative. Use bullets (`  •`) for sub-lists inside a theme when listing many discrete items.

### 5. Confirm

Tell the user the file path and offer to adjust tone, detail, or framing.

## Notes

- Always create `releaseNotes/` if it doesn't exist — `Write` handles this automatically.
- Do **not** include internal ticket IDs (DOMO-XXXXXX) in the final notes unless the user asks; parenthetical attribution is fine.
- Do **not** commit the file unless the user asks.
